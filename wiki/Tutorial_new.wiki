#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

I will assume that you have downloaded the package and everything is working well in your computer. I will also assume that you have usually work on Python. 

Please, be aware that in order for sphviewer to work, your system must have installed matplotlib, numpy, multiprocessing and scipy. 


= Structure of sphviewer=

Attending suggestions from Pablo Benitez Llambay, I modified completely the structure of sphviewer since the previous release (v 0.45). Please, do not use that version because it is deprecated and it will be not longer maintained anymore. 

The current release (v0.88) is structured as a package. There are different modules stores in a main directory. I think in this way it will be easier to maintain and to develop different branches in case it is necessary. 

sphviewer is divided in 4 different classes, which are represented in the following diagram:

http://py-sphviewer.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/figures/sphviewer_scheme.png

  # *sphviewer.Particles:* is the main class which stores the particles information and computes some of their properties which will be used later for making the image. 
  # *sphviewer.Camera:* is the main class which defines the parameters of the camera. 
  # *sphviewer.Scene:* Scene is the class that defines the link between the particles and the camera. In other words, it computes the Scene as seen from the camera point of view. 
  # *sphviewer.Render:* Render is the class that makes the final render. It takes the Scene and take a photo, which can be used later for making a movie.  

With this structure in mind we are going to make an image of a set of particles.

= How to use SPHViewer=

In order to understand how sphviewer works, let's make a disk with a radial density profile. We are going to use 10000 particles. In the next example we are going to use numpy, matplotlib and (of course) sphviewer:  

{{{
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sphviewer as sph
}}}
